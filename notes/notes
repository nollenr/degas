rails generate model grapes name:string, color:string

Wednesday, 10/03
rails generate model Bottle bottle_id:integer, grape:belongs_to
rails generate controller Bottle

Saturday 10/06
rails generate migration AddAvailStatusToBottle availability_change_date:date availability__change_message:string
(Note:  the word bottle must be in the "name".  ActiveRecord uses that key to create the correct migration.  It
will be empty if you don't.)


Done:  Ajax the "consume" function
Done:  Flash messages
Done:  Confirm
Done:  Use after_find (rather than the funny select) for available/consumed bottles... 
       still confused about how that might be working!
Done:  Fixed order by so that the rows are ordered by bottle id.  (BTW, order has to come before all)
Done:  Use attr_writer rather than trying to set an attribute on the model (oops). 
       This seems to be the right way to attack this problem... use a setter/getter method
       along with the after find.
N/A:   When I use the consume function after I've toggled to only available bottles, the display 
       reverts to "all" bottles.  Now that the consume function is Ajaxed, this may be unnecessary.
Done:  What about adding bottles
       Okay... start with building a simple form according to the rails tutorial (Hartl).  Then
       figure out autocomplete... maybe formtastic and formtastic-bootstrap?  Phase 1 looks done.
Done:  Wineries
Done:  Names
Done:  Vintages
Done:  Cellar locations
Done:  Add sorts (with arrows, etc).  How do I sort by a "lookup" column?  (i.e. grape name in the bottles index view)
Done:  Adding wineries
Done:  Ajax looses the table headings.  That's gotta be fixed.
Done:  Make sort changes Ajax.  I think this is all working.  You can sort by any column and the toggle stays 'fixed'

In Progress: Add searches... for just a winery/grape/bottle_id, etc.  Going to try Ransack!
             Not working!  When changed avail/consumed search goes away.  Need to change the "available".
             Now... make it do a post instead of a get.  Then try ajax.

To Do: Index page doesn't work (with :include nor :joins if a foreign key doesn't exist.  In one case
       I get the "nil method" (joins) and in the other case I don't get records with a null fk (include)
To Do: Price on bottles
To Do: Authentication (what about username on bottles, wineries and grapes?  unions for wineries and grapes?)
To Do: Flash a consume... so the user sees the status change.
To Do: Rating wines
To Do: Un-consuming a bottle
To Do: Add autocomplete on bottle entry
To Do: Add a "copy" function for entering bottles of wine.  Should be easy.  Go to the entry
       form with values for the bottle info.
Hold:  Enter a message on the confirm consume pop-up... like date consumed and a note.  I may undo the
       Ajax consume function and go to a page to update the date/message when consuming... then go back
       to the index page.  What would that user experience be like?  Would that make adding a pop-up 
       later easier?  It think so.
To Do: Pretty everything up.
To Do: Clear search fields after search is complete


BTW:
_bottle.erb... uses bottle.bottle_id NOT @bottle.bottle_id becuase it is "called" from
      index.html.erb which has created a local variable for it!
