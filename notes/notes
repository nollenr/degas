rails generate model grapes name:string, color:string

Wednesday, 10/03
rails generate model Bottle bottle_id:integer, grape:belongs_to
rails generate controller Bottle

To Do:
Ajax the "consume" function
Done: Flash messages
Done: Confirm
Done: Use after_find (rather than the funny select) for available/consumed bottles... 
      still confused about how that might be working!
Done: Fixed order by so that the rows are ordered by bottle id.  (BTW, order has to come before all)
Done: Use attr_writer rather than trying to set an attribute on the model (oops). 
      This seems to be the right way to attack this problem... use a setter/getter method
      along with the after find.
When I use the consume function after I've toggled to only available bottles, the display 
      reverts to "all" bottles.

BTW:
_bottle.erb... uses bottle.bottle_id NOT @bottle.bottle_id becuase it is "called" from
      index.html.erb which has created a local variable for it!
