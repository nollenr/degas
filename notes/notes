rails generate model grapes name:string, color:string

rails generate model Bottle bottle_id:integer, grape:belongs_to
rails generate controller Bottle

To Do:
Ajax the "consume" function
Done: Flash messages
Done: Confirm
Done: Use after_find (rather than the funny select) for available/consumed bottles... 
      still confused about how that might be working!
Done: Fixed order by so that the rows are ordered by bottle id.  (BTW, order has to come before all)
Done: Use attr_writer rather than trying to set an attribute on the model (oops). 
      This seems to be the right way to attack this problem... use a setter/getter method
      along with the after find.
