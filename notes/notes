rails generate model grapes name:string, color:string

rails generate model Bottle bottle_id:integer, grape:belongs_to
rails generate controller Bottle

rails generate migration AddAvailStatusToBottle availability_change_date:date availability__change_message:string
(Note:  the word bottle must be in the "name".  ActiveRecord uses that key to create the correct migration.  It
will be empty if you don't.)

To Do:
Done: Ajax the "consume" function
Done: Flash messages
Done: Confirm
Done: Use after_find (rather than the funny select) for available/consumed bottles... 
      still confused about how that might be working!
Done: Fixed order by so that the rows are ordered by bottle id.  (BTW, order has to come before all)
Done: Use attr_writer rather than trying to set an attribute on the model (oops). 
      This seems to be the right way to attack this problem... use a setter/getter method
      along with the after find.
N/A:  When I use the consume function after I've toggled to only available bottles, the display 
      reverts to "all" bottles.  Now that the consume function is Ajaxed, this may be unnecessary.
What about adding bottles
Wineries
Names
Vintages
Cellar locations
Hold: Enter a message on the confirm consume pop-up... like date consumed and a note.  I may undo the
      Ajax consume function and go to a page to update the date/message when consuming... then go back
      to the index page.  What would that user experience be like?  Would that make adding a pop-up 
      later easier?  It think so.
Rating wines
Un-consuming a bottle
Add searches... for just a winery/grape/bottle_id, etc.
Working: Add sorts (with arrows, etc).  How do I sort by a "lookup" column?  (i.e. grape name in the bottles index view)
Working: Adding wineries





BTW:
_bottle.erb... uses bottle.bottle_id NOT @bottle.bottle_id becuase it is "called" from
      index.html.erb which has created a local variable for it!
